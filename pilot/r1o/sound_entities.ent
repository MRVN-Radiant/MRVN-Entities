<point name="ambient_generic" color="1 0 1" box="-8 -8 -8 8 8 8">
Universal ambient sound. Use it to play and control a single sound.
Often used for positional parts of map soundscaped (lapping waves etc.)
-------- KEYS --------
<string key="soundName" name="Sound Name">Soundscript name of the sound to play or direct .wav filename (see scripts/audio/*.txt)</string>
<targetname key="targetname" name="Target Name">UNIQUE Target name</targetname>
<string key="soundscape" name="Soundscape">Soundscript name of the sound to play or direct .wav filename (see scripts/audio/*.txt)</string>
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
<flag key="PLAY_EVERYWHERE" name="Play Everywhere" bit="0">Unused in official maps.</flag>
<flag key="START_SILENT" name="Start Silent" bit="4">Unused in official maps.</flag>
<flag key="NOT_LOOPED" name="DON'T Loop" bit="5">Unused in official maps.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
Inherited from Source Engine
Titanfall appears to have totally refactored how it works
Flags could be deprecated
Soundscripts will set radius etc. and Titanfall never uses raw .wav names
Other keys may be valid, and essential, to using .wav files (.wav should be easier while developing)
Source has a system of manifest.txt files to control per-map audio caching, unsure if Titanfall does the same.
